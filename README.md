# Goal

# Technical requirements 
## Actors:
Firsly I created the nessecary actors of the application. They were:\
-Administrator\
-User
## Use cases:
After determining the actors, the second step in use case analysis is to determine the tasks that each actor will need to do with the system. Each task is called a use case because it represents one particular way the system will be used.
